# HexJacks { ERA : Sixteen (16) Jack I/O board for Eurorack }

Format : ERA / Eurorack / Breadboard Friendly

Height : 1U 

Width: 16HP

Depth : 1.0 cm

Power : (Passive - no power requirements)

HexJacks is a simple sixteen (16) Jack I/O module,
where any Jack can either be used as an input or an output.
Optionally, J9 thru J12 can be populated with pushbuttons for inputs,
and J13 thru J16 can be populated with 3mm LEDs for indicator outputs.

HexJacks can be used on a breadboard for prototyping new circuits,
or it can mounted into a 1U Rack system using the following 1U x 16 HP front panel design.

HexJacks can be used in combination with two (2) or more other ERA modules
for mounting in a 3U ERA or Eurorack format card or even larger rack format

various reference and testing circuits for demonstrating the use of the thingSoC libraries.
These reference designs can serve as starting templates for user designs.
